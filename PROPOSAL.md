# Project Architecture Overview

## High-Level Components

### Frontend
- **Technology**: Leaflet (JavaScript library for map rendering).
- **Purpose**: Displays maps and provides user interaction (zoom, pan, overlays).
- **Deployment**: Hosted in a Docker container, served via Kubernetes.

### Fileserver
- **Technology**: Martin Server.
- **Purpose**: Serves map data (e.g., tiles or vector data) to the frontend or web server.
- **Deployment**: Containerized and deployed on Kubernetes.

### Web Server (API Gateway)
- **Purpose**: Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the fileserver.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles user requests.
  - Routes requests to the fileserver.
  - *(Optional)* Adds logic for authentication, rate-limiting, or data preprocessing.
- **Deployment**: Containerized and deployed on Kubernetes.

### Service Mesh
- **Technology**: Istio.
- **Purpose**: Manages network traffic between services.
  - Provides load balancing, traffic routing, retries, and fallbacks.
  - Handles observability (telemetry, logging, tracing).
- **Deployment**: Installed on the Kubernetes cluster as an overlay.

## Optional Components

### Backup Fileserver
- **Purpose**: Serves as a fallback in case the main fileserver fails.
- **Integration**: Managed via Istio’s traffic routing and failover capabilities.

### Caching Layer
- **Technology**: Redis or Memcached.
- **Purpose**: Stores frequently accessed map tiles or metadata to reduce load on the fileserver.

### Observability Stack
- **Logging**: Fluentd or Elasticsearch for centralizing logs.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for visualization.
- **Tracing**: Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.

### Authentication and Authorization *(Optional)*
- **Purpose**: Secures interactions between the frontend and backend.
- **Technology**: JWT-based authentication or integration with OAuth/OpenID.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - A user interacts with the frontend (e.g., pans or zooms the map).
   - The frontend sends requests to the web server for map data.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - The web server receives the request and routes it to the fileserver for the requested tiles or data.

3. **Service Mesh**:
   - Istio manages the traffic flow, ensuring reliability with features like retries, circuit breaking, and fallbacks.

4. **Map Data Delivery**:
   - The fileserver responds with the required map data, which the web server forwards to the frontend for rendering.

5. **Resilience**:
   - If the primary fileserver fails, Istio reroutes traffic to a backup server (if configured).

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Cluster
- Your Kubernetes cluster hosts all services and the Istio service mesh.

### Pods
- Each service (frontend, fileserver, web server, optional components) runs in its own pod.

### Services
- Kubernetes `Services` expose each component internally within the cluster.
- The frontend may be exposed externally using a `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress` resource.

### Istio Configuration
- Istio manages communication between services using VirtualServices, DestinationRules, and Gateways.

## Key Features

### Resilience
- Managed via Istio’s traffic rules and fault-tolerance mechanisms (e.g., retries, failovers).

### Observability
- Monitoring and logging are integrated to understand the system’s health and performance.

### Scalability
- Kubernetes allows scaling up/down services as required.

### Optional Chaos Engineering
- Intentional failures are introduced to test the resilience of the system under stress.
